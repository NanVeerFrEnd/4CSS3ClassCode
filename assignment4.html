                    Jesus healed the sick everywhere He went, but not always in the same manner. He didn’t have a specific formula that He used every time. When we look at every instance of Jesus healing in the Bible, what do they all have in common? 

                    In every instance of Jesus healing in the Bible, they all had this in common- faith was present.
                    
                    Every time Jesus healed someone, faith was involved. Whether it was in the person receiving the healing, or in Jesus Himself, faith was present in every instance of Jesus healing in the Bible. 
                    
                    Many, many of the miracles that Jesus performed throughout His ministry on the earth were physical healings. It’s really overwhelming to see how much Jesus cared about healing. 
                    
                    Every single person who came to Jesus seeking healing received it. Every person who would allow Him to minister to them was healed. Even a child could understand that Jesus obviously hated sickness and wanted to see people well. Healing was a major part of His ministry. 
                    
                    Jesus healed throughout the entire Bible, in the old testament all the way through the epistles, but what we are specifically going to look at is every instance of Jesus healing found in the Gospels.
                    
                    These are the recording of Jesus healing while He was walking the earth as a man. Let’s look at these occurrences and discover where and how faith was involved. 
                    1. Jesus Heals a Nobleman’s Son at Capernaum in Galilee- John 4:43-54
                    
                    In verse 50 of this recording, it says that the nobleman “believed the word that Jesus spoke to him”. Here was the faith in this instance. The nobleman believed Jesus when he said that His son would live. 
                    
                    Faith is as simple as believing the words of Jesus. If Jesus says you’re healed, then you are. Faith receives what Jesus says as absolute truth. 
                    2. Jesus Heals Peter’s Mother-in-Law Sick With Fever- Matthew 8:14-15, Mark 1:29-31, Luke 4:38-39
                    
                    Jesus touched Peter’s mother in law’s hand, and the fever left her. Jesus had faith that He could lay hands on the sick and see them recover (Mark 16:18).
                    
                    Luke’s account records that Jesus rebuked the fever. Jesus had faith that He had authority over fever, just like His Father. 
                    
                    Mark’s version also records the fact that James and John told Jesus about Peter’s mother-in-law who was sick. They probably did this with faith that Jesus would heal her. 
                    3. Jesus Heals All Who Were Sick at Evening- Matthew 8:16-17 Mark 1:32-34, Luke 4:40-41
                    
                    In this account, the Bible says that Jesus healed all who were sick, fulfilling what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet in Isaiah 53:4. Jesus took the words in Isaiah and believed them about Himself. Jesus got His identity and His faith from the Word of God. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17). Jesus was full of faith that He was indeed the Messiah written about in Isaiah 53. 
                    4. Jesus Cleanses a Man With Leprosy- Matthew 8:1-4, Mark 1:40-45, Luke 5:12-14
                    
                    This recording states that the Leper came and worshiped Jesus, saying “Lord if you are willing, you can make me clean”. The leper had faith that Jesus was able to heal him but wasn’t sure if he would be willing. 
                    
                    During this time, leprosy was believed to be a punishment for the person’s sin. Perhaps this leper believed that he was unworthy of healing. This is where many people today are, they believe that Jesus has the power to heal, but don’t know if He is willing. Jesus revealed His will to the leper, and to us today with His next statement-  “I will. Be clean”. 
                    5. Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant in Capernaum- Matthew 8:5-13, Luke 7:1-10
                    
                    The centurion was full of faith in this account, so much so that Jesus marveled and said he had not found such great faith in all of Israel! 
                    
                    The centurion not only believed that Jesus could heal his servant, but that all He had to do was speak the word. He believed in the authority of Jesus. And look at what Jesus said! 
                    
                    “Go your way. And as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” Matthew 8:13
                    
                    What was the result? The centurion’s servant was healed from that very moment. The centurion received exactly according to his faith. 
                    6. Jesus Heals a Paralytic Who Was Let Down From the Roof- Matthew 9:1-8, Mark 2:1-12, Luke 5:17-26
                    
                    This account shows us clearly where faith was present. The men who were carrying the paralytic were full of faith, so much so that the Bible records that Jesus saw their faith. These men knew that if they could just get this man to Jesus, he would be healed, and they took whatever means necessary to get him there, even breaking open the roof. 
                    7. Jesus Heals a Man’s Withered Hand on the Sabbath- Matthew 12:9-14, Mark 3:1-6, Luke 6:6-11
                    
                    Jesus had faith that healing was the will of the Father, even on the Sabbath, and even if the religious leaders disagreed. The man with the withered hand also received the faith necessary to obey Jesus and stretch out His hand. Where did he get this faith? From hearing the words of Jesus. What Jesus was telling him to do was impossible with the withered hand. Yet, he had faith that when Jesus told him to do something, Jesus would also make it possible. When the man acted on what Jesus said, his hand was restored whole. 
                    8. Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son From the Dead in Nain-  Luke 7:11-17
                    
                    In this instance, the Bible records that Jesus had compassion on this woman when He saw her. This compassion led him to faith-filled action. Faith works by love (Galatians 5:6). The love Jesus had for this woman activated His faith to bring the widow’s son back from the dead. Jesus had faith that what His Father said about His power over death was true.
                    
                    Also, we know that Jesus told the widow woman to now weep. We don’t know this for sure, but perhaps this activated faith within the woman that Jesus was going to change the situation. This reminds me of when Jesus tells us “In this world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). 
                    9. Jesus Heals a Woman in the Crowd With an Issue of Blood- Matthew 9:20-22, Mark 5:25-34, Luke 8:42-48
                    
                    The woman with the issue of blood had faith and said within herself that if she could touch the garment of Jesus, she would be healed. She received exactly according to her faith. Jesus did not even know who touched Him! The faith was completely on her part. Jesus even said that her faith is what made her well. Faith takes what Jesus provides. 
                    10. Jesus Raises Jairus’ Daughter from the Dead- Matthew 9:18,23-26, Mark 5:21-24,35-43, Luke 8:40-42,49-56
                    
                    Jairus had faith that when Jesus laid his hands on his daughter, she would live. Even when someone from Jairus’s house came and told him that the girl had died, he focused his attention on Jesus’ words “Do not fear. Only believe, and she will be made well”. He had faith in those words, and saw what he was believing. 
                    
                    The faith in Jesus was also evident when He told the musicians and mourners that the girl was not dead, but sleeping. Jesus had faith that the girl would live. 
                    11. Jesus Heals Two Blind Men- Matthew 9:27-31
                    
                    These blind men followed Jesus and called Him the Son of David. This phrase “Son of David” shows us that they believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah. They begged Him for mercy. This shows us that they knew His mercy involved the recovery of their sight. 
                    
                    Jesus asks the blind men if they believed He was able to give them their sight back. They replied “Yes, Lord”. This was their faith in action and another example of their belief that He was indeed the Son of God. 
                    
                    Jesus touched their eyes, and their eyes were opened. Jesus had faith in the Scriptures that said the Messiah would give sight to the blind. Jesus told the blind men that this was done for them according to their faith. They had faith that Jesus would have mercy on them and heal them. 
                    12. Jesus Heals a Man Who Was Unable to Speak- Matthew 9:32-34
                    
                    This healing involved the casting out of a demon. Jesus obviously knew that He had authority over demons, to cast them out. His faith was involved, but also the people who brought the man to Jesus also had faith that Jesus could help him. 
                    13. Jesus Heals an Invalid at Bethesda- John 5:1-15
                    
                    In this instance, we see Jesus asking this man questions in order to provoke faith. The man was at the pool of Bethesda, where he believed he could receive healing, but after so many years I believe his hope had waned and excuses had taken over. But even through all of this, Jesus reached out to him and healed him. Jesus loved this man and wanted to see him well. 
                    14. Jesus Heals Many Sick in Gennesaret as They Touch His Garment- Matthew 14:34-36, Mark 6:53-56
                    
                    When the people in Gennesaret saw that Jesus was there, they had faith that they could bring the sick to Him to be healed. They acted according to their faith and sent word to all the surrounding country, bringing all those who were sick to Jesus. These people had faith that if they could touch the fringe of Jesus’ garment, they would be healed. The Bible records that as many touched Him were made perfectly well. They received according to their faith. 
                    15. Jesus Heals a Gentile Woman’s Demon-Possessed Daughter- Matthew 15:21-28, Mark 7:24-30
                    
                    This lady was a Gentile, not even a part of God’s people. She really had no right to expect the blessing of God in her life. After all, she wasn’t a part of God’s covenant at that time. Yet somewhere along the lines she heard about Jesus and had faith that He was indeed the Son of David, Savior of the World. She acknowledged that she was not part of God’s covenant people, but her faith was in Jesus and His goodness, not in herself. Jesus commended her great faith and told her she would have what she desired. 
                    16. Jesus Heals a Deaf and Dumb Man- Mark 7:31-37
                    
                    Again in this recording we see people bringing a man that needed healing to Jesus.    Faith was present in these people. They believed that if they could get this person to Jesus, healing would be the result. They received what their faith believed. 
                    17. Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida-  Mark 8:22-26
                    
                    Again in this account, we see people who had faith bring someone to Jesus to receive healing. Actions will tell you what you really believe. The fact that they brought this blind man to Jesus shows us that they believed Jesus would heal him. Real faith will cause you to act. 
                    18. Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind by Spitting in His Eyes- John 9:1-12
                    
                    In this account, Jesus sees the blind man and explains to His disciples that the work of God is to heal this man. Jesus had faith that healing was His Father’s work. 
                    
                    Jesus anointed the eyes of the blind man with clay and told him to go wash in the pool of Siloam. This man had faith in Jesus, and chose to act on the instructions Jesus gave him. He went and washed in the pool of Siloam and returned seeing. 
                    19. Jesus Heals a Boy With an Unclean Spirit- Matthew 17:14-20, Mark 9:14-29, Luke 9:37-43
                    
                    In this recording, the boy’s father has faith for the healing of his son. But after Jesus’ disciples couldn’t cast the demon out, I imagine that his hopes were dashed. When Jesus arrives on the scene, he makes a statement to the father that provokes faith to come alive inside him again. 
                    
                    Jesus said, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.” Mark 9:23
                    
                    The father began to cry and said that he believed. His faith was activated and he spoke it out. This statement that Jesus made makes it very clear that faith is so important when receiving from God. 
                    20. Jesus Heals a Blind, Mute Demoniac- Matthew 12:22-23, Luke 11:14-23
                    
                    In this instance, Jesus has the faith to heal the man possessed with a demon. I imagine that the people that brought this man to Jesus also had faith that he would be healed. 
                    21. Jesus Heals a Woman Who Had Been Crippled for 18 Years- Luke 13:10-17
                    
                    When Jesus saw this lady, His faith went into action. He saw that she had been bound with a spirit of infirmity and He set her free. She was a daughter of Abraham, in covenant with God, and Jesus knew He had the authority to heal her. 
                    22. Jesus Heals a Man With Dropsy on the Sabbath- Luke 14:1-6
                    
                    Again, Jesus saw a man oppressed with sickness and knew He had come to set free those who were bound. Jesus healed the man, demonstrating the will of God on the earth. 
                    23. Jesus Cleanses Ten Lepers on the Way to Jerusalem- Luke 17:11-19
                    
                    In this occurrence, the lepers came to Jesus asking that He would have pity on them. When Jesus gave them instructions to go and show themselves to the priests, it required faith to obey. 
                    
                    If the lepers had gone to the priests covered in leprosy, they probably would have been killed. Showing themselves to the priests was what was commanded in the law when someone was healed. They had to act on what Jesus said, with faith that when they got there, they would be healed. The Bible says that as they went, they were cleansed. As they put faith in and acted on the words of Jesus, they received their healing. 
                    24. Jesus Raises Lazarus from the Dead in Bethany- John 11:1-45
                    
                    This is a powerful recording of the resurrection of Lazarus. Jesus was operating in great faith and spoke that He would awaken Lazarus from his sleep. Faith speaks what it believes. 
                    
                    Mary and Martha had faith, even if it was shaky. Jesus spoke things to them that would encourage them to strengthen their faith. 
                    25. Jesus Restores Sight to Bartimaeus in Jericho- Matthew 20:29-34, Mark 10:46-52, Luke 18:35-43
                    
                    In this account, Jesus asked Bartimaeus what he wanted from Him. Bartimaeus knew who Jesus was, exactly what he wanted from Him, and that Jesus was able to perform this miracle. He received according to His faith. 
                    
                    Mark’s account of this situation lets us know that Bartimaeus threw aside his garment when Jesus called him. This garment would have identified him as a blind beggar. Bartimaeus was throwing this old identity aside, knowing that Jesus would heal him and he would no longer need it. Jesus tells Bartimaeus that his faith has made him well. 
                    26. Jesus Heals a Servant’s Severed Ear While He Is Being Arrested- Luke 22:50-51
                    
                    Jesus is the Healer. He heals based on who He is, not based on whether or not people deserve it. In this situation, Jesus heals the High Priest, who had come to arrest Him. 
                    
                    Faith is still a vital component when it comes to receiving or ministering healing. Faith has to be present somewhere. 
                    
                    Physical healing did not stop when Jesus was crucified and resurrected. It is still a huge part of Jesus’s ministry today through His followers. In fact, believers are commanded to heal the sick! 
                    
                        Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. Matthew 10:8 NKJV
                    
                    Jesus cares so much about seeing people well. Love always heals. Sickness is an enemy of Jesus. And the Bible tells us that Jesus has not changed. 
                    
                        Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hebrews 13:8 NKJV
                    
                    Jesus’ desire to see the people He encountered on earth healed and whole is the same desire He has to see you healed and whole!
                    
                    Faith is still a necessary ingredient to see yourself or someone else healed. But the good news is that faith has been given to you! When you received Jesus, you received His faith. 
                    
                        To those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: 2 Peter 1:1 NKJV
                    
                    …according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. Romans 12:3 KJV 
                    
                    You already have the faith you need to see your own healing or to lay hands on someone else and see their healing!
                    
                        And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover. Mark 16:17-18 NKJV 
                    
                    Physical healing is supposed to be completely normal for a Christian. Unfortunately, we don’t see the same amount of healing in many people’s lives today as Jesus saw in His.
                    
                    Many people think, “well of course not, Jesus was God in the flesh”. This is true, but Jesus said that the same works He did, you will do as well!
                    
                        Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. John 14:12 NKJV
                    
                    If you are needing healing, I encourage you to really take time and meditate on each of these instances of Jesus healing in the Bible.
                    
                    Think about how you can apply them to your situation. Remember, faith is the necessary component!
